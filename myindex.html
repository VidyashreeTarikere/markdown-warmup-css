<h4>You can always count on me for opening the door as I have the badge. P.S. I have because I live nearby. Yet to earn it</h4>

<h4>Something funny which happened when I was in Kindergarden</h4>
<p>As soon as I started kindergarden, I was very happy to finally leave home and do something(sarcastic). I didn't cry for a week but then saw other kids crying and started weeping everyday after going to school. I feel this is not really funny. But can't think of anything else.</p>

<h4>TL;DR</h4>
<p>The story was not really funny.</p>
